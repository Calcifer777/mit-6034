\section{Nets and Basic Search}

A \textbf{search tree} is a representation, that is a semantic tree, in which:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Nodes denote paths
  \item Branches connect paths to one-set path extensions
\end{itemize}
With writers that:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Connect a path to a path description
\end{itemize}
WIth reades that:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Produce a path's description
\end{itemize}

Each child denotes a path that is a one-city extension of the path denoted by its parent.

If a node has \textit{b} children, it is said to have a \textbf{branching}
factor of \textit{b}. If the number of children is always \textit{b}
for every nonleaf node, the the tree is said to have a branching 
factor of \textit{b}.

Each path that does not reach the goal is called a \textbf{partial path}.
Each path that does reach the goal is called a \textbf{complete path},
and the corresponding node is called a \textbf{goal node}.

Nodes are said to be \textbf{open} until they can be expanded,
whereupon they become \textbf{closed}.

\subsection{Blind methods}

\subsubsection{Depth-first Search}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Form a one-element queue consisting of a zero-length path
    that contains only the root node
  \item Until the first path in the queue terminates at the goal node or the queue is empty,
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Remove the first path from the queue; create new paths
        by extending the first path to all the neighbors of the 
        terminal node
      \item Reject all new paths with loops
      \item Add the new paths, if any to the \textbf{front} of the queue
    \end{itemize}
  \item If the goal node is found, annouce success; otherwise, annouce 
    failure
\end{itemize}

Good when you are confident that all partial paths either reach dead ends
or become complete paths after a reasonable number of steps.

Bad with long or infinite paths, that neither reach dead ends 
nor become complete paths.

\subsubsection{Breadth-first Search}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Form a one-element queue consisting of a zero-length path
    that contains only the root node
  \item Until the first path in the queue terminates at the goal node 
    or the queue is empty,
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Remove the first path from the queue; create new paths
        by extending the first path to all the neighbors of the 
        terminal node
      \item Reject all new paths with loops
      \item Add the new paths, if any to the \textbf{back} of the queue
    \end{itemize}
  \item If the goal node is found, annouce success; otherwise, annouce 
    failure
\end{itemize}


Works with trees with infinitely deep paths.

Wasteful when all paths lead to the goal node at more or less the same depth.

\subsubsection{Nondeterministic search}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Form a one-element queue consisting of a zero-length path
    that contains only the root node
  \item Until the first path in the queue terminates at the goal node 
    or the queue is empty,
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Remove the first path from the queue; create new paths
        by extending the first path to all the neighbors of the 
        terminal node
      \item Reject all new paths with loops
      \item Add the new paths \textbf{at random places in the queue}
    \end{itemize}
  \item If the goal node is found, annouce success; otherwise, annouce 
    failure
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Heuristically informed methods}

\subsubsection{Hill climbing}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Form a one-element queue consisting of a zero-length path
    that contains only the root node
  \item Until the first path in the queue terminates at the goal node 
    or the queue is empty,
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Remove the first path from the queue; create new paths
        by extending the first path to all the neighbors of the 
        terminal node
      \item Reject all new paths with loops
      \item \textbf{Sort the new paths, if any, by the estimated distances 
        between their terminal nodes and the goal}
      \item Add the new paths, if any to the \textbf{front} of the queue
    \end{itemize}
  \item If the goal node is found, annouce success; otherwise, annouce 
    failure
\end{itemize}

Possible issues:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Foothills: an optimal point is found, but it is a local maximum
  \item Plateaus: for all but a small number of positions, all standard-step
    probes leave the quality measurement unchanged
  \item Ridges
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Beam search}

Like BFS in that ir progresses level by level. Unlike BFS, beam 
search moves downward only through the best \textit{w} 
nodes at each level; the other nodes are ignored.

\subsubsection{Beast-first search}

While hill climbing demands forward motion from the most recently created
open node. In the best-first seach, \textbf{forward motion is 
from the best open node so far} no matter where that node is i the
partially developed tree.

\subsection{Which search type is good for me?}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Depth-first search is good when unproductive partial
    paths are never too long
  \item Breadth-first search is good when the branching 
    factor is never too large
  \item Nondeterministic search is good when you are not sure whether
    depth-first search or breadth-first search would be better
  \item Hill climbing is good when there is a natural measurement
    of goal distance form each place to the goal and a good path is 
    likely to be among the partial paths that appear to be good at
    all levels
  \item Beam search is good when there is a natural measure of
    goal distance and a good path is likely to be among the 
    partial paths that appear to be good at all levels
  \item Best-first search is good when there is a natural measure 
    of the goal distance and a good partial path may look like
    a bad option before more promising partial paths are played
    out
\end{itemize}
