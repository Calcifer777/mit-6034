\section{Identication Trees}

\paragraph{Identication Tree} An identification tree is a
represntation, that is a decision tree in which:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Each set of possible conclusion is established implicitly
    by a list of samples of known class
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Average disorder}
\begin{math}
  Average(disorder) =
  \sum_{b}{\frac{n_b}{n_t} \sum_{c}{-\frac{n_{bc}}{n_b}\log_{2}\frac{n_{bc}}{n_b}}}
\end{math}
where:
\begin{itemize}
  \item $n_b$ is the number of samples in brench $b$
  \item $n_t$ is the total number of samples in all branches
  \item $n_bc$ is the total of samples in branch $b$ of class $c$
\end{itemize}

To generate an identification tree using SPROUTER:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Until each leaf node is populated by as homogeneous a
    sample set as possible:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Select a leaf node with an inhomogeneous sample set
      \item Replace that leaf node by a test node that divides the
        inhomogeneous sample set into minimally inhomogeneous
        subsets, according to some measure of disorder
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

To convers an identification tree into a rule set, execute the
following procedure - PRUNER:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Create one rule for each root-to-leaf path in the
    identification tree
  \item Simplify each rule by discarding antecedents that have no
    effect on the conclusion reached by the rule
  \item Replace those rules that share the most common consequent
    by a default rule that is triggered when no other rule is
    triggered. In the eventi of a tie, use some heuristic tie
    breaker to choose a default rule
\end{itemize}
